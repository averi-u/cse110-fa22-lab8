## 1)Check Your Understanding Question Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?   
answer:  
I will choose the option: Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed since it allows the automated tests to be tested checking the program is working at all times.  
## 2) answer: 
No, I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output.
## 3) answer: 
No, because writing a unit test could check whether our program works. We can see whether the receiver can receive the message at last. 
## 4) answer: 
Yes, because writing a unit test could check whether our program works. We can see whether the program would warn the user if they write more than 80 characters.
